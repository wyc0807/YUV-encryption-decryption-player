This is a software piece to view and compare raw YUV sequences. It's so simple
therefore no need to have a help. Currently it can open 36 windows, therefore
display 36 YUV sequences, at one time. You can modify the source code to support
more, but maybe not neccessary.

It reserves many places for improvements. The authors are appreciated if you
would like to share your improvements.

Thanks are expressed to Dagmar Geske and Henrik Thuermer, for the file cscc.lib
and its header file Convert.h were authored by them. These files were originally 
public in the Internet. I even cannot remember when and where I downloaded them.
